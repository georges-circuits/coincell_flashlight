Haven't done a great job of updating the worklog... Anyways. Went from trying to use Standby mode and IWDG to Stop mode and RTC Alarm. seems to work pretty nicely so far. It shouldn't even lose RAM content in Stop mode so that make's things much easier (we'll see how it affects the power consumption though). I'm also worried about any potential hiccups, before it would just restart all the time so that wasn't really an issue but now?

It works beatifully, I'm now working on the menu entry implementation. Really like the way everything smoothly fades in and out and is responsive.
